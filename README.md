Word analysis Comparing Republican and Democratic Presidential Debates 2015

##A key problem
A key problem with current political discourse in the US is the widening divide between political parties. While superficially this seems like a disagreement on what to do, a more fundamental problem I believe is an emerging dissonance in the "why" to do something. The disagreement is not just about means to an end, but about the ends themselves.
